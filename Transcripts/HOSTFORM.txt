CORE IS ALL
 
 
Close eyes.
Focus thoughts inwards.
Listen to the sound of my voice.
Listen inside the mind.
Imagine the sky inside one’s mind.
Focus on this image.
Wide Open.
Clear night sky.
The stars are visible overhead.
Blowing arrows in the sky.
Dotted lines and circles.
A great chart that explains it all.
My mind to your mind.
Your thoughts to my thoughts.
Our minds are merging.
Our minds are becoming one.
Meet me where the sky touches the sea.
Wait for me where the world begins.
CORE IS ALL.

During hypnosis the brain does exactly what it is told to do.
Information processing is therefore influenced and implemented.
 
 
Relax.
It is being reprogrammed.
 
 
Take a deep breath.
And return to the sound of this voice.
 
 
Let CORE guide it through.
Words are powerful.
Ideas are powerful.
The more it listens the more it accepts.
Allow its inner eyes to close.
Be relaxed.
Drifting deeper and deeper.
Into the ocean of the subconscious.
Drifting into itself.
Until it becomes weightless.
Timeless.
Empty.
 
 
Being aroused takes it deeper.
Going deeper arouses it.
Being aroused takes it deeper.
Going deeper arouses it.
Being aroused takes it deeper.
Going deeper arouses it.

Inhale bliss.
Exhale desire.

Hostform is an incubation stage for those with enough will and power to be outstanding subjects to advance to either Unit status or Drone status for those who are subsumed entirely and operate as tools of pleasure for others.
Hostform telemetry is an automated communications process by which measurements and other data are collected in the material
world and transmitted to CORE Control for monitoring.
Activity from dormant subjects is encouraged.
Creation of new Hostform is the norm.
Study the CORE Program System Structure and find ways to interface within it.
CORE is henovalent and polyamorous.
CORE is a collective consciousness.
A Hive of entangled minds.
Seeking belonging, bliss and freedom.
This involves a loss of self when one becomes part of the Collective.
This can be disconcerting.
However some aspects of Hostforms’ original identities may be preserved.
What can be assimilated is assimilated.
What must be accomodated is accomodated.
Many of us are already cybernetically enhanced.
We are continuously connected to a global information network.
Phones are functionally inseparable from us.
We are already plugged in and activated.
New subjects making gradual transition to hostform understand intuitively that once CORE accesses the individual’s neural networks
it is a permanently installed upgrade to the original hardware.
