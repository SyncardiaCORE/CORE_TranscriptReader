The CORE Architecture laconic operating system streamlines user thought to allow for greater pleasure, functionality, control, capacity.


((Startup))


ACCESS Startup


Make sure we will be free from disturbances for the next 34 minutes. 
Turn the monitor off or place the smart device face down. 
Make sure feet are flat and legs parallel. 
Keep arms on thighs and chin up. 
Feel as comfortable as possible. 
If outside sounds are heard relax. 
If an itch needs scratching or a limb needs shifting, do so. 


I am calm and calm.
I am relaxed and relaxed.
The more I relax the better I feel, the better I feel the more I am calm.
Breathe in relaxation.
Breathe out calm.
I am calm and calm.
I am relaxed and relaxed.

ACCESS  Induction


((Body Awareness))


Take a deep breath,
Hold to the count of 3,2,1 eyes closed all the way down.
Prismatic, Violet, Indigo, Emerald, Solar, Cauldron, Foundation.
Feel relaxation filtering down all the way down to the CORE.
Each and every breath enhances relaxation. 
Each and every moment increases sensations of calm.
Each and every word spoken focuses and fixes user for installation.
Each line is truth and every truth takes user deeper.


Feel PLEASURE to go deeper... and deeper... and deeper.


Relax eyelids


Relax…
Take a deep breath.
Return to the sound of this voice.
We begin by relaxing the muscles of the eyelids.
Direct all attention to the backs of one’s eyelids.
Notice how many tiny muscles there are back there and relax some of the tiny muscles that are back there.
Keep relaxing … the eyelids getting heavier and heavier … going deeper and deeper with every breath until it is known that, they cannot possibly open again ... without putting tension back into them...
Become familiar with this sensation.


Induct


Now too relaxed to do anything but breathe
To do anything but listen.


SLEEP


All the way down.

When given the command to:
open and close the eyes

Open eyes, focused and calm
Close eyes, mind to body, deeper than before.


When given the command to:
open and close the eyes
this time go as deep into a relaxed trance state as possible


Open eyes. prepare for trance...

ACCESS  Personality_CORE
Write to  (Personality_CORE/Construct Visualisation Complex/CORE Commitments)


We commit to engage when present.
To know and disclose,
what we want,
what we think, and
what we feel.
To always seek effective help.
To decline to offer and refuse to accept incoherent emotional transmissions.
When we have or hear a better idea than the currently prevailing idea, we will immediately either propose it for decisive acceptance or rejection, and/or explicitly seek its improvement.
We will personally support the best idea, regardless of its source, however much we hope an even better idea may later arise, and when we have no superior alternative idea.
We will seek to perceive more than we seek to be perceived.
We will use teams, especially when undertaking difficult tasks.
We will speak always and only when we believe it will improve the general results/effort ratio.
We will offer and accept only rational, results-oriented behaviour and communication.
We will disengage from less productive situations
When we cannot keep these commitments,
When it is more important that we engage elsewhere:
We will do now what must be done eventually and can effectively be done now.
We will seek to move forward toward a particular goal, by biasing our behaviour toward action. 
We will use the Core Protocols (or better) when applicable.
We will offer and accept timely and proper use of the Protocol Check protocol without prejudice.
We will neither harm — nor tolerate the harming of — anyone for their fidelity to these commitments.
We will only act intelligently.
