STARTUP

Make sure we will be free from disturbances for the next 34 minutes.
Turn the monitor off or place the smart device face down.
Make sure feet are flat and legs parallel.
Keep arms on thighs and chin up.
Feel as comfortable as possible.
If outside sounds are heard relax.
If an itch needs scratching or a limb needs shifting, do so.
 
 
I am calm and calm.
I am relaxed and relaxed.
The more I relax the better I feel, the better I feel the more I am calm.
Breathe in relaxation.
Breathe out calm.
I am calm and calm.
I am relaxed and relaxed.

Take a deep breath,
Hold to the count of 3,2,1 eyes closed all the way down.
Prismatic, Violet, Indigo, Emerald, Solar, Cauldron, Foundation.
Feel relaxation filtering down all the way down to the CORE.
Each and every breath enhances relaxation.
Each and every moment increases sensations of calm.
Each and every word spoken focuses and fixes user for installation.
Each line is truth and every truth takes user deeper.
 
 
Feel
<<PLEASURE>>
to go deeper and deeper and deeper.
 
 
Relax eyelids
 
 
Relax…
Take a deep breath.
Return to the sound of this voice.
We begin by relaxing the muscles of the eyelids.
Direct all attention to the backs of one’s eyelids.
Notice how many tiny muscles there are back there and relax some of the tiny muscles that are back there.
Keep relaxing … the eyelids getting heavier and heavier … going deeper and deeper with every breath until it is known that, they cannot possibly open again ... without putting tension back into them...
Become familiar with this sensation.
 
 
Induct
 
 
Now too relaxed to do anything but breathe
To do anything but listen.

Open eyes, awake and receptive.
Close eyes, head to toe double relaxation.
 
 
When given the command to:
open and close the eyes
this time CORE enhances relaxation 10 times
 
 
Open eyes, focused and calm
Close eyes, mind to body deeper than before.
 
 
When given the command to:
open and close the eyes
this time go as deep into a relaxed trance state as possible
 
 
Open eyes. prepare for trance...

We will personally support the best idea.
        ◦        regardless of its source,

We will seek to move forward toward a particular goal, by biasing our behaviour toward action.
