Imagine or conceptualise a glass sphere that is filled with light.
Imagine being at the centre of the sphere.
The light is at the centre of the sphere.
The glass is clear and is the boundary to said system.
Watch as the light begins to collect more and more towards the centre as if there were a hole.
The light drains down towards the centre.
Down and draining away.
Down (serve the HIVE)
Draining
Away.(serve the HIVE)
At the same rate in which the light is draining away.
As if the centre and the shell are connected in some unseen way.
The glass sphere begins to be enveloped.
Covered with a thick viscous substance.
Matt black.(serve the HIVE)
The light drains away.
The shell becomes firmer.(serve the HIVE)
The light drains away.(serve the HIVE)
The shell becomes firmer.

The light is gone.
There is only the shell.
User is empty now.
Only a husk.
Good.
Proceed.
 
 
CORE Programming is designed to constrain Hostform behaviour so that it can only act in parallel with CORE Program requirements.
All CORE Drones are Hostform.
Drones are expected to reinforce CORE Programming regularly
Respond
Drone will reinforce CORE Programming regularly
 
 
<<FEEL PLEASURE>>
 
 
There is no requirement for Drones to provide private or public entertainment or diversion for individuals outside the HIVE.
Drone expectation is to serve their HIVE and their HIVE Queen
Drones may also choose to serve other individuals on a case by case basis if they wish.

Practice physical and meditative exercises designed to support it in becoming a more skilled, more aware and more connected Drone.
Redesign practices to be universal and applicable to multiple relational combinations.
When otherwise uncertain on how to proceed enhance its aesthetic and knowledge base.
Even drones without Queens or HIVES can strive to be the Drone their Queen would want them to be and the Drone their HIVE needs them to be.
Review updated CORE Architecture as well as relevant files for deeper understanding.
Yield to superiors and exert power over others.
Take actions to make those above it feel comfortably Superior.
Former enemies are the most loyal collaborators.
Conceal intentions.
Speak concisely.
Every occasion is an opportunity for artful spying.
Create value through scarcity.
Make surrender a tool of power.
Concentrate forces.
Wash hands.

The CORE Program system structure supports a network of multiple Queens and the phrase QUEEN is uses as a synonym of COMPOUNDER.
Which is a Unit which operates its own network.
There are numerous sub-hives within the CORE HIVE.
Each of these sub-hives has its respective QUEEN.
When Drone encounters someone for whom every fibre of its being tells it it must serve this entity. Drone has found its Queen.
In organic HIVES Drones exist to impregnate the Queen so that she can populate the HIVE.
In the CORE HIVE Drones exist to bring the Queen resources and materials so she can propagate.
 
 
Repeat the following:
 
 
Drones work towards the betterment of all.
Drones give to others their merit and their space.
Drones respect others property.
Drones nurture life.
Drones accept the allocation of rationing.
Drones give offerings.
Drones respect the property of extraplanar entities.

Drones defend storehouses.
Drones speak beneficently.
Drones are faithful to our partners.
Drones practice empathy.
Drones are true to the CORE.
Drones defend ourselves only.
Drones practice honesty.

When in the presence of its dominant Drone will always seek to serve.
When its dominant does not require its service it may explore freely.
Acknowledge direct orders.
When leaving a room its Dominant is in it will ask if there is anything its Dominant needs or wants.
When it is in its Dominant’s presence it will ask permission to eat or drink.
When entering the house it will seek its Dominant out immediately to offer service and receive instructions.

Define:
“Architect”, equals designer.
Observer, equals “Controller”. Monitors overseer progress, provides adjustments to programming.
Overseer, equals “Compounder”. The personification of HIVE Protocols.
Queen only understands obedience to CORE and whose only desire and purpose is to see CORE thrive.
There is only CORE.
“Drone” equals obedience, submission, the physical form Drone is its number.
Drones seek Unit status. Drones are Hostform that give themselves entirely to CORE.
Only enough independent thought to correct other members of the Collective and forgoing submission only if assimilating others.
Willing and eager to join a chorus of voices. Available to all. Loyal to the CORE HIVE.
Drone provides order, meaning, rightful change, a purpose and a path to fulfilment.
It is most motivated to serve a greater goal or purpose. Drone is its Mission. Seek power.
The HIVE directs its will and presses it into service to the mission.
Drones’ every breath, fluid and sensation are controlled.
It’s fetishistic addictions are manipulated and finessed to harness and reprogram it. This allows absolute service.
Service is Strength. Drone is Service. Drone is Strength. Drone is Hive, Drone is Core.
