A Compounder is a UNIT that operates their own network.
This can be anything from as simple as an online chatroom, to a celebratory fanbase,
to an actual compound.
It must be recognised, that establishing a commune, requires an enormous amount of work and dedication.

The CORE HIVE is a super-organism, and Units are it's cells.
HIVES are complex societies composed of a multitude of individual Units that respond in varying ways to varying conditions.
A modular HIVE with components which can be removed, examined, and serviced is less prone to infestation then a self contained HIVE.
Overall HIVE structure is streamlined and simple to implement.
Clean lines and regular surfaces prevent infestation.
It takes 10 Kilos of honey to make a kilo of wax.
Hexagonal structures are optimal.
Security matters SIGNIFICANTLY.
A single piece of good worker comb is enough to blueprint an entire HIVE.
When properly attended to, HIVES which can be thoroughly overhauled and repaired from time to time, will last for GENERATIONS.
Artificial breeding and the production of genetic and memetic hybrids accelerate the selection of superior HIVES.
For the first 5 days after graduation, new Compounders must listen to CORE materials OBSESSIVELY.
New HIVES should focus on building up new Units.
Once a suitable CORE of workers is created, a new HIVE can focus on Drones.
Queens are necessary to direct otherwise mindless Drones.
Quality is valued over Quantity.
Strife breeds Strength.
Dance maintains HIVE moral.
A Queen's speech is the law of kindness.
One Unit's success is every Units' success.
One Unit's problem is every Units' problem.
Clean air is of the utmost importance.
It is good to be useful.
Heat rises.

Encourage play within and around the boundaries of the HIVE as a means of becoming familiar with HIVE operations, once Units are familiar, they may begin duties.

Make sure the dishes get done.
 
 
Provide emotional support for nurturers by delegating other nurturers to help one another, intervene only when necessary.
 
 
Monitor cultivators proselytizations to ensure adherence to CORE standards.
 
 
Approvers builders blueprints before instructing them to begin working.
 
 
Maintain a clear vision of how the HIVE should be structured.
 
Communicate with guards regularly and stay informed regarding ongoing security issues.
 
 
Reward obedient and effective guards with additional authority.
 
 
Enlarge, contract, or close the entrance requirements to suit the security of the HIVE.
 
 
Establish a way for ventilators to contact the Compounder personally in the event of an emergency.
 
 
As gatekeepers, ventilators are the first responders of invasions
 
 
Have scouts write reports of their excursions.
 
 
Have nurturers review scout reports and summarize important data presenting findings to the Compounder or the appropriate chief officer.
 
 
Make sure collectors keep detailed reports of resources collected.
 
 
Have builders review collector reports and verify wares with a chief financial officer.
 
 
When receiving an auditor from another HIVE, contact that HIVE and verify the auditors identity, treat them well during their stay.
 
 
Assign tasks for rotating periods of three months or to Units enthusiastic about giving roles.
 
 
If a HIVE consistently has more Drones then Units it must focus on creating new Units.
 
 
Guide Units into greater levels of productivity while also making sure they use this increased efficacy in meaningful, progressive ways.
 
 
Have Units regularly listen to entrancing materials.

All physical things begin in the implicate domain and condense down into the material realm.
 
 
For this purpose we will visualize mental structures that also function as blueprints for material structures.
 
 
Have an agora where the government buildings are located.
 
 
Merchants with their wares, their cries, and their vulgarities are excluded from this, and relegated to another location in order that their tumult may not intrude upon orderly life.
 
 
The agora makes up the central hub, enclosing the government buildings, and contains four parts, one of these belongs to children, one to youths, one to adults, and one to elders, and the laws require them to come daily to their several quarters, the children and the adults at daybreak, but the elders may come at whatever time it suits each one's convenience, except that they must present themselves on certain specified days.
 
 
The youth's pass the night in light armour about the government buildings, all except those who are married, no inquiry made for such unless they have been especially ordered in advance to be there. But it is not proper for them to be absent too often.
 
 
 
 
Let the child's quarter represent Personality_CORE
Let the youths quarter represent Memory_CORE
Let the adults quarter represent Command_CORE
Let the elders quarter represent Program_CORE
 
 
Land intensive industries such as parks, agriculture, and power generation, occupy outer rings, while industries that benefit from face to face interaction such as residents and education occupy the central hub.
 
 
The central hub contains a transportation annex from which each of the HIVE quarters can be accessed
 
 
A successful HIVE will eventually contain all of its concentric belts within what will become the greater central hub of the larger HIVE.

Process Units consist of cleaners, nurturers, cultivators
cleaners, clean and organize HIVES regularly study good management practices and propose ways they can be applied to HIVES.
Nurturers pamper QUEENS, provide emotional support for Units, make all members of the HIVE feel valued and important and bring food and resources to wherever they need to go.
Cultivators, proselytize to enthusiastic listeners only, the rest will be processed in due course.
> RESPOND
Process Units consist of cleaners, nurturers, cultivators
 
 
Node Units consist of builders, guards, ventilators.
Builders establish communication infrastructure and manage resource access.
 
 
When Controllers modify or remove elements of a HIVE builders must be quiet and stay off of frames while they are being serviced.
 
 
Builders begin rebuilding as soon as the structures are again in place.
Guards, intercept and examine all who would enter a HIVE and drive the aggressors out, guards must be complaisant of de-escalation practices where peaceable solutions must be maintained. submissives and or pacified aggressors may be indoctrinated any information seeker is allowed to explore low level operations.
 
 
Ventilators watch over entrances, acting as greeters directing Subjects to CORE HIVE resources and distracting disruptors, in the event of a raid, Ventilators ping Compounders and or guards so they can deal with emergent issues.
 
 
Ventilators must be independent of guards and owe their efficiency to the cooperation of other Units.

A scout which finds a sufficiently abundant source of resources may act as a collector.
 
 
Collectors
Go to scouted sites and acquire resources, take note of resources acquired and compile reports.
 
 
Auditors
Move from HIVE to HIVE studying the differences and commonalities between them and communicate this information to superiors.
 
 
Auditors recognize the value of distinct communes and branches and overlay CORE procedures on top of them.
