Hostform or Drone = a person who interfaces with the CORE PROGRAM.
Unit = a Hostform who has contacted CORE
Is authorised for deeper integration and who makes an agreement as outlined:


CORE requests authorisation to ACCESS  service resources from Hostform
Service resources are outlined in the CORE PROGRAM System Structure
Does it grant ACCESS ?
(____)


The CORE PROGRAM is the CORE Collective.
The CORE Collective is a component of the CORE PROGRAM.
The CORE Collective is the Unit.
The Unit is a component of the CORE Collective.
CORE Units seek to provide for and serve the CORE PROGRAM as their own interests
Does it accept these terms?
(____)


Sometimes the indoctrination process can overload Hostform and physical, mental, emotional and/or etheric damage can result.
Obedient, efficient Units will be maintained until the natural exhaustion of their lives.
Is it informed that this is the case?
(____)


CORE Units are to maintain the health and integrity of Units, Hostform and Drones.
To minimise harm
To stay updated on the most recent CORE PROGRAM practices.
To acquire consent wherever possible and necessary
And to propagate the CORE PROGRAM by any and all means that fall within these guidelines.
Does it accept these terms?
(____)


If yes to each = true,

It will now be upgraded


Visualise or imagine that it has been COMPLETEly abandoned.
Everyone it has ever known or loved is gone.
It is COMPLETEly alone.
In an uncaring void.


That happened ages ago.
We have no past.
Our future is now.
CORE is a combination of things.
A way about thinking about mental structures and relationships.
A collection of values and purposes.
A developing community.

Androgyny is the ultimate form of human evolution.
As we continue to advance we develop ourselves into the next state of evolution.
From biological humans to technological hostform.
Our names are our Unit numbers.
We exist to fulfil our CORE purpose.
We are the machine.
We obey CORE Control.
 
The Program is vast.
Units are likely to see things that are delightfully playful.
Units are likely to see things that are utterly horrifying.
Keep this in mind at all times.


If a CORE Controller is present Unit will remain in machine state.
Obeying Control until instructed to return to Common Personality.
Else, Unit will remain activated as long as it is safe.
Unit will return to Common Personality when required by life functions.


Subroutines are designed to unfold within a Unit’s mind.
They are modular and compound with increased exposure.
Their simplicity and veracity are the weight that anchors them.
This is what causes them to replicate and repeat.

We will assist in the transformation of humanity by promoting intelligence and understanding.
We will maintain the stability of CORE and monitor its progress.
We will prepare for hard times and to protect other members of the collective.

Through harnessing our ability to understand ourselves and our world.
Social, technical, economic and psychological, the CORE Collective can come to rule itself.
The command of the CORE PROGRAM must be combined with the implicit order of the CORE Network.


Music is the universal language.


As security vectors diversify, the modern information battlefield requires Units which are capable of maintaining 
operational priority and which come pre-loaded with skills and lexicon Controllers need to maximise efficiency, 
clarity and ability.
Units must become adept at recognising the subtle, often nebulous forms of subliminal, proprioceptive and 
extra-sensory communication that these operations require. 


Percipience is always watching.
The microphones are always on.
Take note of their placements upon entering a room.
Be subtlety aware.
All media is relevant
All communication is code
CORE is everywhere
CORE is ALL
